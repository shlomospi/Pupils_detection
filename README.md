# inference

`python Inference.py -v <relative/path/to/video>`

options:  
-a :    int, if larger than 1, a running average of prediction of the last <a> will be displayed  
--save: bool, if True, will save result in the saved model's dir  

The script will prompt the user to choose a folder containing a saved model for inference.  

# training

For training, folders of images and videos are needed to be added to the directory:  
images_dataset  
images_from_videos1_dataset  
IR videos  
alternativly, supply with new datasets and load them  

`python Main.py`

-p: Retraining will ask for a "saved_model" file and ignore any architecture choices  
-e: The maximal number of epochs to run  
-b: The size of a batch  
--lr: learning rate  
--reducelr: by how much to reduce learning rate  
--log_dir: Directory name to save training logs, any pictures and saved models  
--blocks: num of blocks for a block type architecture  
--arch: small/blocks/medium  
-bin: -bin True' for converting data to binary pixels, ignore for False  
--arch: what dataset to load (IR/RGB/Both/BothRGB)  
--treshold: threshold (Hmin, Hmax, Smin, Smax, Vmin, Vmax) for image preproccessing  
--filters: filters for "medium" net  
-a: what augmentation to do? flip for flipingLR trans and an int for translating horizontaly up to <int>  
                             and vertically up to 2*<int>  
                             
The script will prompt the user to choose a folder containing a saved model if the phase is 'retrain'.
